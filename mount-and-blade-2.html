                            <h4>Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord</h4>

                            <p>Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the eagerly awaited sequel to the acclaimed medieval combat simulator and role-playing game Mount & Blade: Warband. Set 200 years before, it expands both the detailed fighting system and the world of Calradia.</p>
                            
                            <p>Explore, raid and conquer your way across the vast continent of Calradia, making friends and enemies along the way. Raise your own army and lead it into battle, commanding and fighting alongside your troops in the thick of the action.</p>
                            
                            <p>Play the game the way you want to play it! Plot your own path to power in a dynamic sandbox adventure where no two playthroughs are the same.</p>
                            
                            <p>See the availability of goods ebb and flow in a simulated feudal economy. Turn anarchy to your advantage by being the first to bring grain to a starving town after a siege or reopening a bandit-plagued caravan route.</p>
                            
                            <p>Customize the game to experience an entirely different adventure of your creation. The engine and tools used to develop Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord are being made available to the community so that modders can re-interpret Calradia or create their own worlds!</p>
