            <h5>What is the Unepic Games Store?</h5>
            
            <p>The Uepic Games Store is a curated digital storefront for only the PC master races, designed with both players and creators in and out of mind. It’s focused on providing great games for gamers whiles also keeping in mind that some gamers are OMEGA broke, and a fair deal for game developers. When you buy a game on the Unepic Games Store, 100% of the price goes directly to developers (literally no joke), versus only 70% on many other stores (cuz others store suck). This helps developers invest into building bigger and better games that pretty much still buggy af mostly when they came out.</p>
